## Toolbox dialog
Click the [coral][] button in-game to open the toolbox.
Alternatively, click More > Modding Toolbox in the main menu.
In it there are some tools:

# Script Editor
Here you can edit scripts that can be used by other tools.
You can export it to an array of lines for use in 5.0 shaders.

# Update
This function is run every tick, when not paused.
To always run it, use [stat]Draw[]

# Draw
This is like [stat]Update[] but run on the client thread, and even when paused.
Draw.* functions take screen coordinates, not world units.
The fields [green]w[] and [green]h[] are set to the size of the screen.

# Exceptions
If an exception is thrown, the function will be disabled and the error will be printed to the log

# Shaders

The shader viewer is quite simple.
There is a router which is affected by your shader.
There are 3 parts to a shader:
	Vertex glsl,
	Fragment glsl,
	Apply function

The vertex shader changes where the router's corners are.
The fragment shader gives each pixel its colour.
The apply function sets uniforms like the time, screen size, etc.
